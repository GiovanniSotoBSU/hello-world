This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
My name is Giovanni Soto and I am a Computer Science major at BSU. I graduated from Meridian Technical Charter High School in 2020 with a job as a Developer and Tech Support at the company Riafox.
I attended Rochester Institute of Technology for a year before taking a break from school for personal reasons. I am now completing my degree at BSU.
